MVP Development

    1. This version is supposed to support only the engineering license exams
    2. This version will just have the question and answer format with some corresponding tags
    3. The db is architected in such a way that it will be easily upgraded to incorporate multiple exams, countries or tests

    
    ## DB architecture:
        1. Tables:
            - questions : stores each quiz question
            - question_options: stores 4 options per questions, marks the correct ones
            - tags : master list of all tags (topics, concepts, etc.)
            - question_tags: mapping table (many-to-many) between questions and tags

    ## going with the aws RDS postgre with followig configuration:
        db.t4g.micro
        2vCPUs
        1 GiB RAM
        20 GiB

        the main reason for selecting this is the cost:
        0.019 USD/hour

## THIS IS LOOKING COSTLY
## Moving to docker and dev. after mvp pushing to aws

##setup postgreSQL in AWS(done)
